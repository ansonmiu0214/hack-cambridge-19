Well my name is Darren King and this is the developer video as far as the congressional app challenge. I learned an acquired and many new skills during the entire process of developing my application. during the application creation. I had to learn business like skills such as time management project management programming skills and image manipulation skills. UM I gained a lot of valuable information in regards to programming and the Java language as well as scripting and XHML and HTML.
And then had to utilize image software such as Gimp and Photoshop to acquire images to use as part of my application. Overall, the experience was very valuable and itâ€™ll open a meaningful amount of doors to me, I will continue my education in this field and continue to learn new languages and new concepts and features as my career develops.
