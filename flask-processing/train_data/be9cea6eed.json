I think that my experience with technology and in particular, my birthdays maintainer update websites. Make me a good match for this position and my most recent position, I was responsible for maintaining our Department website, which requires updating students and faculty profiles and posting information about upcoming events and my free time I learn to code in Java script and Swift and then used my coding skills to revamp my homepage. And received praise on my other part. So students for men do shit. I would love to bring my coding skills and my general passion for learning new technologies to this position.
