Based on what you said Anne from the research. I've done your company is looking for an administrative assistant who is strong in both interpersonal and communication skills. I believe my experiences aligned well with that. I'm skilled at communicating with diverse people across all platforms phone, email and in person. For example, when I was the administrative assistant for a college Chemistry Department. Our Department organized national conference from the 6 month leading up to the conference. I was the point person for all the conference participants and attendees, including students professors administrators and the general public.
